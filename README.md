# Recommendation-Systems

A recommender system  is a machine learning tool used to predict and suggest items to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or similarities to others. In the context of game recommendations, it suggests games to players based on their past playing history, preferences, or similar player profiles, like how platforms such as Steam recommend new games based on previous activity. In crop recommendation systems, these systems assist farmers by suggesting optimal crops to plant based on factors like soil quality, climate, and historical yield data, helping improve agricultural productivity by providing data-driven recommendations tailored to specific conditions.
